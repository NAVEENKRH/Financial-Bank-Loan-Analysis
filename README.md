## Project Overview

### Problem Statement (STAR Method)

**Situation:**  
The bank is facing challenges in effectively monitoring the performance of its loan portfolio. There is a need for better visibility into key metrics related to loan applications, funded amounts, and borrower profiles. This lack of comprehensive data insights hinders decision-making processes, leading to potential risks in the lending operations.

**Task:**  
We need to create a detailed report and dashboard that categorizes loans by their status (Good vs. Bad) and includes key performance indicators (KPIs). The report should provide insights into various metrics such as total loan applications, total funded amounts, and average interest rates. Additionally, we must visualize trends, regional analyses, and loan purposes to help stakeholders understand the lending landscape and inform strategic decisions.

**Action:**  
I developed a comprehensive grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status,' showcasing metrics such as:
- Total Loan Applications
- Total Funded Amount
- Total Amount Received
- Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount
- MTD Amount Received
- Average Interest Rate
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

I also created visualizations using Power BI, including:
- A line chart for monthly trends by issue date to identify seasonality
- A filled map for regional analysis to pinpoint lending activity hotspots
- A donut chart for loan term distribution
- A bar chart for employee length analysis
- A tree map for home ownership analysis

The 'Details Dashboard' was designed to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics, ensuring that users can access vital loan data efficiently.


**Result:**  
The implementation of this detailed report and dashboard allowed the bank to gain actionable insights into its lending operations. The clear visualizations and grid views facilitated better understanding among stakeholders, leading to improved decision-making and a more robust assessment of the loan portfolio's health. As a result, the bank has enhanced its ability to manage risks and optimize its lending strategies.
